Matlab Toolbox
------
- **GNJD_Software_Package**: <br>**Authors**: Xiaofeng Gong, **Xiulin Wang**, Qiuhua Lin<br>Generalized Non-orthogonal Joint Diagonalization (GNJD) is an algorithm to simultaneously perform multiple asymmetric NJD upon multiple sets of target matrices with mutually linked loading matrices. It is a promising method to multiset data analysis problems such as joint blind source separation (J-BSS) and multiset data fusion. This software package provides source programs of GNJD to enable reproduction of the results in the published paper. We provide the routines of all the 5 experiments in the paper for our algorithms (GNJD and 2 other earlier related works). Results for other competitors, however, are not included to avoid copyright conflicts. Data and some routines for the last 2 experiments are obtained from internationally published benchmarks. We include them in the package to enable successful execution for these examples. [[User Guide](../_publications/User_Guide.pdf)]     [[Download](../_publications/GNJD_Software_Package.rar)]
