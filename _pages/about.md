-I am a joint-training PhD student at [University of Jyv채skyl채](https://jyu.fi/en) and [Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/), working with Prof. [Tapani Ristaniemi](http://users.jyu.fi/~riesta/) and Prof. [Fengyu Cong](http://www.escience.cn/people/cong/index.html). I am a member of [SPWC lab](https://www.jyu.fi/it/en/research/research-areas/software-and-telecommunication-technology/signal-processing) and [ASAP lab](http://www.escience.cn/people/cong/asap.html).

-I obtained my master degree from Dalian University of Technology, and was supervised by Associate Prof. [Xiaofeng Gong](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/xfgong/zh_CN/index/699431/list/index.htm). I obtained my bachelor degree from [Shandong University, Weihai](https://www.wh.sdu.edu.cn/), and was advised by Associate Prof. [Sumei Li](https://ie.wh.sdu.edu.cn/info/1073/1253.htm).
