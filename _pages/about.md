- I am now an assistant researcher at the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University. 
-  From 2017 to 2020, I was a Ph.D. student (software and communications engineering) at the Faculty of Information Technology, [University of Jyväskylä](https://jyu.fi/en), Finland, supervised by [Tapani Ristaniemi](http://users.jyu.fi/~riesta/) and [Fengyu Cong](http://www.escience.cn/people/cong/index.html). My thesis was concerned with "coupled nonnegative matrix/tensor factorization in brain imaging data". I was a joint-training Ph.D. student at [University of Jyväskylä](https://jyu.fi/en) and [Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) from 2016 to 2017.
